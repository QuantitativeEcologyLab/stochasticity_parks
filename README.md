This repository contains the code and figures generated throughout my honours thesis, which was focused on examining environmental variability across Canada between 1980 and 2023 and how this relates to protected arease across the country. 

The folder `Scripts` contains 4 files which were used for the download, annotation, analysis and figures created in this project. The figures generated can be found in the folder `Figures`.
