All shapefiles of Canada were previously available via the Open Government Licence (version 2.0; https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada):

* Ecodistricts: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/fe9fd41c-1f67-4bc5-809d-05b62986b26b
* Protected areas: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6c343726-1e92-451a-876a-76e17d398a1c

However, the shapefile of 2024 protected area was obtained through a direct request to [scf-geocarto-cws-geomapping@ec.gc.ca](mailto:scf-geocarto-cws-geomapping@ec.gc.ca). The Ecodistricts data was downloaded from [https://databasin.org/datasets/8dca767690af48e6ae5581b34612a19d/](https://databasin.org/datasets/8dca767690af48e6ae5581b34612a19d/) as provided by the Canada Ecological Stratification Working Group.

The shapefile of water bodies was created starting from the shapefile from [https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e750071279bf450cbd510454a80f2e63](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e750071279bf450cbd510454a80f2e63).

The NDVI data were downloaded using the script in `Scripts/001-NDVI_AVHRR_download.R`.
